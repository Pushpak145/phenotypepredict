Machine-Learning for Predicting Phenotype in Yeast, Rice, and Wheat
Project Overview
This project applies machine learning algorithms, including SVM, Random Forest, Lasso, Ridge, and Gradient Boosting, to predict phenotypes from genotype data across yeast, rice, and wheat datasets. It aims to showcase the potential benefits in agriculture and medicine.

Datasets
The repository includes three datasets: yeast.txt, wheatNSGC9K_6Xsamplesheet.csv, and rice.csv. Each dataset contains genotype and phenotype information essential for the machine learning models to predict the phenotypes.

Usage
Main Code: PhenotypePredict.py runs the prediction models and evaluates their performance.
Test Code: python test.py provides additional validation and testing of the model's predictions.
